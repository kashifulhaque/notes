### `echo`

`echo` command prints a string or a environment variable

Example:

`echo $HOME`

`echo Hello, World`

### Frequently used shell variables

- `$USERNAME`
- `$HOME`
- `$HOSTNAME`
- `$PWD`
- `$PATH`

### Special shell variables

- `$0` â†’ Name of the shell
- `$$` â†’ Process ID of the shell
- `$?` â†’ Return code of previously run program
- `$-` â†’ Flags set in the bash shell

### Process control

- Use of `&` to run a job in the background
- `fg`
- `coproc`
- `jobs`
- `top`
- `kill`

### Program exit codes

- 0 â†’ success
- 1 â†’ failure
- 2 â†’ misuse
- 126 â†’ command cannot be executed
- 127 â†’ command not found
- 130 â†’ processes killed using `Ctrl + C`
- 137 â†’ processes killed using `kill -9 <pid>`

### Flags set in `bash`

- `h` â†’ locate and hash commands
- `B` â†’ brace expansion enabled
- `i` â†’ interactive mode
- `m` â†’ job control enabled
- `H` â†’ ! style history substitution enabled
- `s` â†’ commands are read from stdin
- `c` â†’ commands are read from arguments

### `echo`

```bash
echo Hello World
echo "How do you do?"
```

*it's a start*

We can enclose the string in quotes as well

Make sure to match the quotes properly

### Some common `echo` commands

```bash
echo $USERNAME
echo $USER
echo $PWD
echo $HOME
echo $HOSTNAME
echo $PATH
```

We can enclose the shell variable (marked as $) in double quotes, and it'll replace the value

***However, if we use single quote around the shell variable, the shell variable is printed as it is***

We can also escape the shell variable by using a backslash in front of it

**Example â†’** `echo "User is \$USERNAME"` will display `User is $USERNAME`

### To view all the shell variables

```bash
printenv
env
```

`printenv` prints all or part of the environment

```bash
printenv HOME
```

### `set`

`set`Â allows you to change the values of shell options and set the positional parameters, or to display the names and values of shell variables. ([Source](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html))

### To escape any aliases set already

```bash
\<alias>

# Example
\ls
\date
```
