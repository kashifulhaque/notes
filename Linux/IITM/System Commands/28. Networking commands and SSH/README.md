### Ways to gain remote access

- VPN access
- SSH tunnelling
- Remote desktop: x2go, rdp, pcoip
- Desktop over browser: Apache Guacomole
- Commercial, over internet: Teamviewer, AnyDesk, Zoho assist, ...

### SELinux

- Security Enhanced Linux mode available on Ubuntu too, apart from server grade flavours like CentOS, Fedora, RHEL, SuSE Linux, etc.
- Additional layer of access control on files to services
- Role Based Access Control
- Process sandboxing, least privilege access for subjects
- Check using `ls -lZ` and `ps -eZ`
- RBAC items:
    - user (unconfined_u)
    - role (object_r)
    - type (user_home_t)
    - level (s0)
- Modes:
    - disabled
    - enforcing
    - permissive
- Tools:
    - semanage
    - restorecon

SELinux is recommended for all publicly visible servers

### High Performance Computing

- Look at [www.top500.org](http://www.top500.org) for statistics
- Accessing a remote HPC machine is usually over SSH
- Long durations jobs are submitted to a job scheduler for execution
- Raw data if large needs to be processed remotely before being transferred to your machine
- Comfort with the command line is a must
