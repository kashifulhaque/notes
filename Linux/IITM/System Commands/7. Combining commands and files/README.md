### Executing multiple commands

- `command1; command2; command3`
    - Each command will be executed one after the other
- `command1 && command2 && command3`
    - This works as a logical AND
    - The subsequent commands after `command-n` will not run if the previous command resulted in an error
- `command1 || command2 || command3`
    - This works as a logical OR
    - The subsequent commands after `command-n` will not run if the previous command resulted in a success

### `(<command>)`

We can run any command enclosed within parentheses to execute them in a subshell, and returned back the result

*We can execute a subshell within a subshell too*

### File descriptors

Every command in Linux has 3 file descriptors

- `**stdin` $(0)$**
    - It is a pointer to a stream that is coming from the keyboard (or the user input)
- `**stdout` $(1)$**
    - Points to the screen where the output is made
- `**stderr` $(2)$**
    - Points to the screen where the output is made

### `command > file1`

- The output of the `command` should be written to `file1`

**Create a file using `cat` command**

`cat > filename`

When we type this command, the `cat` command is supposed to receive the input from a file that is listed in the command line, but instead, we left that intentionally blank

So, the `cat` command, instead, reads the content from the `stdin`, i.e. the keyboard

*To exit, press* `Ctrl + D`

### `command >> file1`

- The output of `command` will be appended to `file1`

**Similarly, we can use `>>` instead of `>` while creating a new file using the `cat` command**
