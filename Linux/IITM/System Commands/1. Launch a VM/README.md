### Why do we need a Virtual Machine (VM)?

- Laptops usually come pre-installed with Windows
    - Unless, of course, you are an üçé person
- We wish to try Linux almost natively, without removing the existing OS
    - Also considering the fact that we do not wish to dual boot

### Requirements

- An .iso image of the operating system we want
    - Ubuntu 20.04 is recommended, or just use arch btw

        - Can be downloaded [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- A Hypervisor
    - A¬†**hypervisor**, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is
    software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor
    allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually
    sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.

    - [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
    - [VMWare Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/in/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
    - or just use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
    - Atleast 20GB free space for the VM
    - Some RAM ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
        - 8GB+ recommended

### Steps

- Download the Ubuntu .iso file from [https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- Download either VirtualBox or the VMWare Workstation Player
    - Install them
- Open VirtualBox / VMWare Workstation Player
    
    (I will be using VirtualBox)
    
    - Click on the ‚ÄúNew Button to create a new VM‚Äù

    - Adjust the RAM and Storage as per your liking, make sure to keep the minimum specs
    - Select the VM on the left menu and go to settings

    - Proceed with the installation
        - Uhh it‚Äôs just Next, Next, Next .... Next ... Restart

When you install it correctly and get it up and running, you might see something like this ...
