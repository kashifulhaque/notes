**List the files of `/usr/bin` directory, but use the `less` command to scroll at ease**

`ls /usr/bin | less`

### `command1 | command2 > file1`

- The `stdout` of `command1` is mapped to `stdin` of `command2`
- The `stdout` of `command2` is written to `file1`
- The `stderr` is output to the display

### `/dev/null`

- A sink for output to be discarded
- Use â†’ silent and clean scripts

So, a typical usage looks like ...

### `command > file1 2> /dev/null`

- The output of `command` is written to `file1`
- The `stderr` is written to `/dev/null`, *~~which gets warped to another dimension~~*

### `command1 | tee file1`

- The `tee` command splits the output into 2 streams, one stream is written to the `file1` another, one to the display
    - This command can write to multiple files as well
