### `readlink`

Prints the resolved symbolic links or canonical file names, *but what does that mean?*

If we have file which is a symbolic link to file which in turn is another symbolic link to a file and so on ...

The `readlink` command will display the actual file the initial symbolic link is referring to

**Example usage**

`readlink -f /usr/bin/pico`

***Output***

`/usr/bin/nano`

It is a config file that is read by the bash shell everytime it opens
